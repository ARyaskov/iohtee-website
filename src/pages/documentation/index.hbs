        <p>
            Payment channel is a method to pass a value as little as 1 Wei instantaneously between two parties. Parties are free to transfer funds as many times as they need. The payment channel groups all the little transfers so that a blockchain sees two transactions only: opening a channel and closing the channel. It makes an individual transfer inside the channel cheaper than a conventional blockchain transaction.
