        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            An idea behind Machinomy project is to allow any device to pay another
            device a minuscule amount of money over the internet.
            Current implementation is a Node.js package. It represents a somewhat constrained vision:
            allows a device to instantly pay a fraction of Ether over HTTP, no trust established.
            Actually, the device is a networked computer able to run geth
            and Node.js. A server or your laptop qualify, as well as Raspberry Pi board.
        </p>

        <p>
            Paying over HTTP for service implies there is a buyer and a seller. As a simplification for future developments,
            buyer is called <i>sender</i>, and seller is named <i>receiver</i> below.
        </p>

        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <pre><code>$ npm install -g machinomy</code></pre>
        <p>
            Then set it all up using your ethereum account. By default, machinomy uses
            <a href="//blog.ethereum.org/2016/11/20/from-morden-to-ropsten/">Ropsten</a>, a current test network,
            to prevent erroneous expenditures. Console commands also assume
            you act on behalf of sender side.

        <p>
            For a receiver side provide an option <code>-n receiver</code> or <code>--namespace receiver</code>.
        </p>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="https://asciinema.org/a/0yo57pswmuaw1k5i9cxmnngtt.js" data-theme="solarized-light" id="asciicast-0yo57pswmuaw1k5i9cxmnngtt" async></script>
        <p>
            You could override any password provided here using environment variable, as will be shown below.
        </p>

        <h2>Buy</h2>
        <p>
            Now, after you set it up, start local geth instance. For now, machinomy is not itself an Ethereum node.
            Then, issue <code>machinomy buy</code> command:
